# 📝 TODO App

A simple and lightweight TODO application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This app allows users to **add** and **delete** tasks, with all data saved in the browser's **local storage** — ensuring your tasks persist even after closing or refreshing the browser.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Add new tasks
- ❌ Delete existing tasks
- ✔️ Mark tasks as completed
- 💾 Data persistence using `localStorage`
- 📱 Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- ⚡ No backend or database required

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Add Task:** Enter text and click the add button. The task gets saved in `localStorage`.
2. **Mark as Completed:** Click on the task or a checkbox to toggle its completed state.
3. **Delete Task:** Click the delete button to remove a task from the list and from `localStorage`.
4. **Persistent Storage:** All data is stored locally in the browser, so your tasks are safe even after closing the tab.
